## 3. User Flow

A new user lands on Sygnize’s modern, clean landing page where the value of automatic website monitoring is clearly presented. They can sign up or log in using email authentication or a third-party method (via Clerk). During the sign-up process, users choose their role (Standard, Power, or Guest), which customizes the set of features available to them. Once registered, users are guided through an onboarding process that briefly explains how to add and monitor websites and configure notifications.

After completing onboarding, the user is taken to a central dashboard that shows all active monitors, recent change logs, and an introduction to the navigation panel. From here, users can add new websites by entering a validated URL and using the click-to-select interface to pick specific elements for monitoring. They can further configure the frequency of detection and set up their notification preferences. As changes are detected, AI-powered analyses generate concise summaries and users receive real-time notifications, making it easy to review updates via the analytics dashboard and historical tracking sections.

    *   Relying on the availability and efficiency of third-party services such as GPT-4, Supabase, Stripe, and Resend.com.
    *   Initial version is strictly for web-based usage and the prescribed features; mobile adaptation is excluded in this phase.

*   **Assumptions:**

    *   Users have a basic level of web literacy and can navigate modern web interfaces.
    *   The targeted user segments (real estate, business analysis, etc.) will benefit from tailored monitoring, and their needs have been correctly identified in the requirements.
    *   Development and deployment will leverage best practices provided by tools like CodeGuide Starter Pro for rapid scaffolding and adherence to robust project structures.

## 8. Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Rate Limits and Resource Management:**

    *   The real-time monitoring system might hit rate limits on the target websites or third-party APIs. It is suggested to implement caching or batching strategies and carefully handle API error responses to mitigate this risk.

*   **Complexity in Visual Element Selection:**

    *   The click-to-select interface could face challenges with dynamic or heavily scripted websites. Testing on different website layouts and ensuring fallback mechanisms for elements that are hard to capture will be crucial.

*   **Balancing Frequency and System Load:**

    *   Setting very short intervals for monitoring can strain the system resources and raise hosting costs. A recommendation is to optimize resource usage with a configurable frequency cap and to monitor performance metrics post-deployment.

*   **User Configuration Errors:**

    *   Improper URL entries or misconfigured notification settings can lead to errors. Robust validation and error messaging must be in place to prevent such issues.

*   **Subscription and Payment Handling:**

    *   Integrating Stripe with various pricing tiers might present edge cases in billing cycles or refunds. Detailed testing and clear user messaging around subscription changes are necessary to ensure smooth operations.

This PRD should serve as the single source of truth for the development of the Sygnize platform, providing clear guidance for all subsequent documents such as the Tech Stack Document, Frontend Guidelines, Backend Structure, and more. Every part of the system, from user onboarding to notifications, is detailed to leave no room for ambiguity in the development process.
